# Overview 
This is the front-end component that is powered by the back-end service defined by the cigna-insurance-chatbot repository. 

It allows users to chat with either a Q&A chatbot that answers general insurance questions, or a bot designed to sell business owners group health insurance for their employees. This is a basic front end created with Streamlit. Please refer to the backend respository for the behind the scenes/ technical details.
